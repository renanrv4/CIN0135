# üíª Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming with C++
This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in **Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures using C++**. Here, I document all the exercises and projects I completed as part of the Data Structures course.

>Through this subject, I not only learned a new programming language but also explored efficient ways to store and manipulate data. It also gave me the opportunity to strengthen my logic and programming skills.

# üóÇÔ∏è Folders
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different type of activity or material developed during the course ‚Äî such as mind maps, exercises, and projects.

- ## Practical Activities (APs)
  [Practical Activities](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0135/tree/master/APs) -
 This folder contains all the hands-on exercises I completed to learn the fundamental concepts covered in the course.

- ## Data Structures (Estruturas)
  [Data Structures](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0135/tree/master/Estruturas) -
  Here you'll find all the data structures I implemented during the course, from basic to more advanced ones.

- ## Practical Lists (LPs) 
  [Practical Lists](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0135/tree/master/LPs) -
  A collection of exercises that helped me apply data structures in various problem-solving scenarios.

- ## Mind Maps (MMs)
  [Mind Maps](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0135/tree/master/MMs) -
  This folder contains all the mind maps that I did to learn and review all the contents, from the basics of C++ to learning fundamental data structures.

- ## Project (Projeto)
  [Project](https://github.com/renanrv4/CIN0135/tree/master/Projeto) -
 For project activity, we developed an expression interpreter (handling both logic and arithmetic expressions) using Object-Oriented Programming.
I initially struggled with understanding and implementing recursive descent parsing, but over time I grasped the concept and successfully implemented the algorithm.
